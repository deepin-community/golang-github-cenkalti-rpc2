Description: Bi-directional RPC (library)
 rpc2 is a fork of net/rpc package in the standard library. The main goal
 is to add bi-directional support to calls. That means server can call the
 methods of client. This is not possible with net/rpc package. In order
 to do this it adds a *Client argument to method signatures.
